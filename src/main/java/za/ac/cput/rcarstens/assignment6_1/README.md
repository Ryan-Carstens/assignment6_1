can purchase tickets for upcoming events, as well as create their own events.
If the customer's selected operation is purchase, the user is then able to select 
the event/events that customers want to buy tickets for, as well as navigate 
the cart to complete their transaction. The cart will calculate the total amount
for the customers ticket purchase order. If their selected operation is to create
an event, then the user will be able to define the events respective details and
ticket details, and then their event will be registered for customer interaction.

DESCRIPTION:

According to the model, a customer with a compulsory emailID and accountNumber, 
has names, contact information, customer address and customer bank details. The
service keeps track of a customers ticket transactions via a 'cart', where the 
purchase totals are calculated by recording the amount of items 
purchased for each respective event, and summing for a total to be paid and then 
approved by making a bank transaction. The customer my also choose to create 
their own events, which people in future will be able to select and buy tickets
to attend. The event details will all be captured by creating an event type of 
either Festival, Club Party, Seminar or Wedding respectively. Once they have 
created their event they can then set their own ticket details including price, 
eventID, TicketID and Date/Time. Things such as the amount of tickets available
for an event, and whether the tickets are limited or sold out will also be 
handled.
